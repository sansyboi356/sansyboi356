## Hi there 👋

## I'm sansy or Time depending on where you find me, either is fine

## I'm currently working on a (https://github.com/sansyboi356/pointchecker) (havent in a while) that puts a games guild points into text then into a google sheet (they dont have api's :/ )

## Just learning python as a hobby, might try java and other things in the future

## If anybody can help me figure out why the output for the text in the checker is so inaccurate please let me know 🙏

## I'm a dude lmao

## Fun fact: I did this out of boredom

##if you want to contact me my username is the same on discord as it is here, just my display is time or something to that effect
